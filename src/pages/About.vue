            <p >Mr. Vetrivel was the founder of VivasaayaNadu Trust along with a team of software professionals from Chennai. This was an initiative to protect underprivileged farmers from debt-traps and suicides. Post the Jallikattu movement, he felt the necessity to work along with local farmers and to uplift them in our society.</p>
            <p >During his work with the Trust, he was informed of adulteration in Milk and dairy products, this was of great concern to children who were the primary consumers of Milk.</p>
            <p >Mr.Vetrivel and his brother Mr.Panneerselvam acknowledged this fact and wished to be suppliers of fresh dairy products. They aspire to protect native cow breeds and to help marginalized farmers. Hence they did not start a dairy farm but introduced local farmers into their business.</p>
