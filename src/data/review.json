But after being a customer of Uzhavarbhumi for past 15 days, I feel it's very worth for the cost to buy milk from them. On-time delivery, the freshness of milk that apt for the kids(Mostly the breakfast for early school going kids), and I am super excited when I tried the curd, it is very thick and tasty. Yet to try Ghee, Paneer which I am damn sure it will be very good. Thanks Uzhavarbhumi for being the part of our life!!!",
